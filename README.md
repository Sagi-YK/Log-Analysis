# Log-Analysis

# Project Requirements
 
## 1. Project Overview
 
The project involves creating a tool that can process a large CSV file named NPK Logs, analyze it, and output a sequence diagram. Each column in the log, representing a process, will be represented as a character in the sequence diagram. The diagram will highlight areas in green, orange, and red, indicating PASS, WARNING, and DANGER areas, respectively. The tool will also learn from past issues and solutions to provide AI-based recommendations for future problems.
 
## 2. Data Input
 
The tool should:
 
- Accept an input CSV file named NPK Logs.
- Read and parse the CSV file, which contains different processes in each column along with associated data.
- Handle a vast amount of data efficiently without performance degradation.
 
## 3. Data Analysis
 
The tool should:
 
- Identify unique processes (each column in the CSV) and treat each as a separate character for the sequence diagram.
- Analyze the data associated with each process to determine the status (PASS, WARNING, DANGER).
 
## 4. Sequence Diagram Generation
 
The tool should:
 
- Generate a sequence diagram where each character represents a unique process from the CSV file.
- Highlight areas on the diagram in green to represent PASS status.
- Highlight areas on the diagram in orange to represent WARNING status.
- Highlight areas on the diagram in red to represent DANGER status.
 
## 5. Diagram Filtering
 
The tool should:
 
- Provide the ability to filter the sequence diagram presentation based on various parameters (such as status, process type, etc.).
 
## 6. Machine Learning and AI Recommendations
 
The tool should:
 
- Learn from previous sequence diagrams and associated solutions.
- Provide AI-based recommendations for issues identified in the sequence diagram.
- Continuously improve its recommendations as it learns from more sequence diagrams and solutions.
 
## 7. Code Structure
 
The code should:
 
- Be modular and utilize interfaces to ensure it is open for extension but closed for modification.
- Follow appropriate design patterns to ensure scalability and maintainability.
- Be well-documented and easy to understand for future developers working on the project.
 
## 8. User Interface
 
The tool should provide:
 
- A user-friendly interface for uploading the CSV file.
- Clear and concise visual representation of the sequence diagram.
- Easy identification of each status (PASS, WARNING, DANGER) with color-coding.
- A section for AI-based recommendations for resolving identified issues.
 
## 9. Performance
 
The tool should:
 
- Process large CSV files quickly and efficiently.
- Generate sequence diagrams without significant delay.
 
## 10. Documentation and Support
 
The project should include:
 
- Comprehensive documentation detailing how to use the tool.
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues.
- Contact information for further support or inquiries.
 
## 11. Security
 
The tool should:
 
- Ensure data privacy and security during file upload and data processing.
- Not store any sensitive data after the session ends.
